Write UDP client and server programs in Python that the
client gets a set of integers and the length of the set as
command line arguments. Then the client sends the set to
the server. Afterward, the server computes the total, the
highest number, the lowest number, and the mean (in float)
of the set and sends the results to the client. Finally, the
client receives the results and prints them out.
